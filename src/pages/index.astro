				Noobing With The Noob
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hi! I am Ishan! I go by NoobScience online. I am a student and technology is my JAM. I do have an official blog on Hashnode but I wanted a more personal space to write about my thoughts and ideas. I am a big fan of the vanilla web and I wanted to build this blog from scratch. So I am using a NextJS base for my site. All blog posts are indiviual javascript files and are compiled into static HTML pages. No database, no server side rendering. No Complex CSS frameworks too.

			Okay, as you can see I want to be not talking about technology, 
			but it leaks into my words. Anyways, this is a place I just randomly 
			share my thoughts. There's a plan for more improvements and features, 
			but for now, this is it. If you want to discuss something, please feel 
			free to reach out on <a href="htt*"><i class="bi bi-twitter"></i> Twitter</a>. One more thing, I am not a native English 
			speaker, so please excuse any grammatical errors.

		I hope you enjoy your stay here. I'll try to keep this blog updated
		 as much as I can. I'll see you around!
		Trying something out
		I have been thinking about this for quite a while now and I want to try
		 it out. So this blog is a subsidiary of the main site NoobScience and is
		  hosted on the same server. The code is available on GitHub. So, if you
		   want to write a article on this blog, you can just fork the repo, 
		   write your article and send a pull request. I'll review it and merge it. 
		   Cool Right ?! Feel free to try it out. More info and guidelines coming soon.
